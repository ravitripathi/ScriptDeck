Got scripts scattered across your mac? Tired of changing directories and hunting for that one shell script? ScriptDeck simplifies managing scripts by providing a single place to launch them from, and maintaining a single directory for storing them.

# Installation
Add the [tools](https://github.com/ravitripathi/homebrew-tools) homebrew tap and install

```
brew tap ravitripathi/tools
brew cask install scriptdeck
```

# Features
- Add shell scripts (or any other executable script) directly from your status bar
- Scripts are saved in `~/Documents/ScriptDeckStore` with executable permissions.
- Background mode runs the script without launching a terminal instance. macOS notifications are triggered at the start and completion of your script.
- Ships with a editor with syntax highlighting, powered by [Highlightr](https://github.com/raspu/Highlightr)
- Scripts are launched with the default Terminal.app. If you prefer iTerm or any other terminal app, select it in the `Preferences` window.

# Existing scripts

For launching your existing shell scripts present in other directories, use the standard `source` command.

`source /path/to/your/script`
